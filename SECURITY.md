## Reporting a Vulnerability

***Please note: As this is a free tool which offers no income for me I am not offering a Bug-Bounnty of any kind at this time.***

Please open an [Issue](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/Zorin-OS-Pro/issues>) or start a [PR](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/Zorin-OS-Pro/pulls>) if you have identified any issues!

If you wish to disclose any vulnerabilities you have found privately you may use [The Security Tab](<https://github.com/NanashiTheNameless/Zorin-OS-Pro/security>).
